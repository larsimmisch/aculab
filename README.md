# Python wrappers for Aculab

This is an old and obsolete Python API for the DSP and Call Control
cards from [Aculab](http://aculab.com).

Despite its limited usefullness, I am publishing it here because I
am still rather fond of it. I think the sample scripts demonstrate
quite clearly which elements go into the handling of a call with DSP resources,
and how things tie together.
